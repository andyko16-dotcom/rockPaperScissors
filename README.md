A Game of RockPaperSissors in Javascript

What my goal is creating RockPaperSissors in JS:
    My goal is to refresh my memories on creating fucntion and passing return from one function to another. I hope that by the end of this I have a firmer grasp on creating functions, if else statements, for loops/while loops (maybe?). I also hope that I learn more technical skills with css and maybe use javascipt to enchance the design of my game.
