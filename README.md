# rockPaperSissors
A Game of RockPaperSissors in Javascript

What my goal is creating RockPaperSissors in JS:
    My goal is to refresh my memories on creating fucntion and passing return from one function to another. I hope that by the end of this I have a firmer grasp on creating functions, if else statements, for loops/while loops (maybe?). I also hope that I learn more technical skills with css and maybe use javascipt to enchance the design of my game.

    - I created the foudation of game in html,js,css
    - created foundation of rockpapersissors
    - need to fix randomCompChoice; returns undefined

2/1/2023: 2hrs~
   - corrected spelling errors
   - decided to make a pixel art fighter style verison of rock paper scissors
   - planning how i would like my website to look

2/3/2023: 4+ hrs~
   - after two days of planning i have decided to make a rock paper scissors game with minigames within it
   - i have decided also to add player movement similar to pokemon
   - the minigames i have decided to add are going to maybe be pong, a time limit survival, button mashing game
   - today i have also created sprites from pokemon fire red

2/4/2023: 8hrs~
   - i have add player movement
   - updated sprites so it fits nicely on the canvas background img
   - trying to create boundaries

2/5/2023: 3hrs~
   - got stuck on having boundaries fit in the right place
   - learned to not believe typeof for parameters
   - now trying to get img of character looking down width and height bc it is reading Nan
   - fixed having boundaries fit in the right place

2/6/2023: 3hrs~
   - skipped a step in tutorial: figured out how to get character width and height
   - came across an error when i would collide with collision block: it was a simple typo error that took me 3 hours to figure out.

2/7/2023: 3hrs~
   - after finishing collision blocks, i have started working on battlezones
   - this works the same as collision blocks, but i am stuck again with having character trigger console.log when character is touching battleZone.
